# DynamicXml
[Dynamically Deserialize XML](https://github.com/MikePreston17/DynamicXml) to typed C# classes (POCOs) by use of the dynamic keyword - without the use of the default Serialization library!

This is mostly a concept, but could be expanded upon for extracting streams of POCOs from long swathes of XML, HTML, etc.

Folders 'DynamicXmlTests1' and 'DynamicXMLTests2' both do not exist in my local repo, but exist here.  Ignore #2.  #1 has some useful tests.
